NAME
       ntfsinfo - dump a file's attributes

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsinfo [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsinfo  will dump the attributes of inode inode-number or the file path-filename and/or information about the mft ( -m option).  Run ntfsinfo without argu‐
       ments for a full list of options.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsinfo accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by  -  and  the  long
       name  is  preceded  by  --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.
       Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -F, --file FILE
              Show information about this file

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not overwriting an existing file.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -i, --inode NUM
              Show information about this inode.

       -m, --mft
              Show information about the volume.

       -q, --quiet
              Produce less output.

       -t, --notime
              Do not display timestamps in the output.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the amount of output that ntfsinfo prints.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license.
