NAME
       ntfslabel - display/change the label on an ntfs file system

SYNOPSIS
       ntfslabel [options] device [new-label]

DESCRIPTION
       ntfslabel will display or change the file system label on the ntfs file system located on device.  It can also change the serial number of the device.

       If the optional argument new-label is not present, and no option is present, ntfslabel will simply display the current file system label.

       If  the  optional  argument  new-label is present, then ntfslabel will set the file system label to be new-label.  NTFS file system labels can be at most 128
       Unicode characters long; if new-label is longer than 128 Unicode characters, ntfslabel will truncate it and print a warning message.

       It is also possible to set the file system label using the -L option of mkntfs(8) during creation of the file system.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfslabel accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by -  and  the  long
       name  is  preceded  by  --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.
       Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not working with a mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       --new-serial[=ssssssssssssssss], or

       --new-half-serial[=ssssssss]
              Set a new serial number to the device, either the argument value, or a random one if no argument is given. The serial number is a 64 bit number,  rep‐
              resented  as  a sixteen-digit hexadecimal number, used to identify the device during the mounting process. As a consequence, two devices with the same
              serial number cannot be mounted at the same time on the same computer.  This is not the volume UUID used by Windows to locate files  which  have  been
              moved to another volume.

              The  option  --new-half-serial  only  changes the upper part of the serial number, keeping the lower part which is used by Windows unchanged.  In this
              case the optional argument is an eight-digit hexadecimal number.

       -n, --no-action
              Don't actually write to disk.

       -q, --quiet
              Reduce the amount of output to a minimum.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the amount of output that ntfslabel prints. The label and the serial number are displayed.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license for ntfslabel.
