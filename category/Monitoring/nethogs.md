NAME
       nethogs - Net top tool grouping bandwidth per process

SYNOPSIS
       nethogs [-h] [-V] [-d] [-v] [-t] [-c] [-p] [-s] [device(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       NetHogs  is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down per protocol or per subnet, like most such tools do, it groups bandwidth by process - and does not rely on
       a special kernel module to be loaded. So if there's suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can fire up NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing this, and if it's some kind
       of spinning process, kill it.

   Options
       -h     display available commands usage.

       -V     prints Version info.

       -d     delay for refresh rate.

       -v     select view mode

       -p     sniff in promiscious mode (not recommended).

       -t     tracemode.

       -c     limit number of refreshes

       -s     sort by traffic sent

       device(s) to monitor. By default eth0 is being used.

INTERACTIVE CONTROL
       m      cycle between display modes (kb/s, kb, b, mb)

       r      sort by 'received'

       s      sort by 'sent'

       q      quit
