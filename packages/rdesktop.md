NAME
       rdesktop - Remote Desktop Protocol client

SYNOPSIS
       rdesktop [options] server[:port]

DESCRIPTION
       rdesktop  is a client for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), used in a number of Microsoft products.  It is known to work with Microsoft Windows server versions ranging from NT 4 ter‐
       minal server to Windows Server 2012 R2.

OPTIONS
       -u <username>
              Username for authentication on the server.

       -d <domain>
              Domain for authentication.

       -s <shell>
              Startup shell for the user - starts a specific application instead of Explore.  If SeamlessRDP is enabled this is the application which is started in seamless mode.

       -c <directory>
              The initial working directory for the user.  Often used in combination with -s to set up a fixed login environment.

       -p <password>
              The password to authenticate with.  Note that this may have no effect if "Always prompt for password" is enabled on the server.  WARNING: if you specify a password  on  the
              command line it may be visible to other users when they use tools like ps.  Use -p - to make rdesktop request a password at startup (from standard input).

       -n <hostname>
              Client hostname.  Normally rdesktop automatically obtains the hostname of the client.

       -k <keyboard-map>
              Keyboard  layout  to  emulate.   This requires a corresponding keymap file to be installed.  The standard keymaps provided with rdesktop follow the RFC1766 naming scheme: a
              language code followed by a country code if necessary - e.g.  en-us, en-gb, de, fr, sv, etc.

              The default keyboard map depends on the current locale (LC_* and LANG environment variables). If the current locale is unknown, the default keyboard map is en-us (a US Eng‐
              lish keyboard).

              The keyboard maps are file names, which means that they are case sensitive. The standard keymaps are all in lowercase.

              The keyboard maps are searched relative to the directories $HOME/.rdesktop/keymaps, KEYMAP_PATH (specified at build time), and $CWD/keymaps, in this order. The keyboard-map
              argument can also be an absolute filename.

              The special value `none' can be used instead of a keyboard map.  In this case, rdesktop will guess the scancodes from the X11 event key  codes  using  an  internal  mapping
              method. This method only supports the basic alphanumeric keys and may not work properly on all platforms so its use is discouraged.

       -g <geometry>
              Desktop  geometry  (WxH[@DPI][+X[+Y]]).  If  geometry  is  the  special  word  "workarea",  the  geometry  will  be  fetched from the extended window manager hints property
              _NET_WORKAREA, from the root window. The geometry can also be specified as a percentage of the whole screen, e.g. "-g 80%", "-g 80%x70%".

              If the specified geometry depends on the screen size, and the screen size is changed, rdesktop will automatically reconnect using the new screen size.  This  requires  that
              rdesktop has been compiled with RandR support.

              The  optional  DPI  parameter should be specified if the screen rdesktop is being displayed on is too far from 96 DPI for unscaled Windows to be readable. Windows currently
              accepts values from 96 to 480.

              Offset placement of window is optional. Starting point is upper left corner of screen.  Window manager might push into visible area, if  a  panel  would  be  covered.   The
              schema is "-g <value>+<xoff>+<yoff>, f.e. "-g 30%+200+600".

       -i     Use password as smartcard pin. If a valid user certificate is matched in smart card reader the password passed with p argument is used as pin for the smart card.  This fea‐
              ture also requires that smart card redirection is used using r scard argument.

       -f     Enable fullscreen mode.  This overrides the window manager and causes the rdesktop window to fully cover the current screen.  Fullscreen mode can be toggled at any time us‐
              ing Ctrl-Alt-Enter.

       -b     Force the server to send screen updates as bitmaps rather than using higher-level drawing operations.

       -t     Disable use of remote control. This will disable features like seamless connection sharing.

       -A <seamlessrdpshell>
              Enable  SeamlessRDP  by  specifying the path to seamless rdp shell.  In this mode, rdesktop creates a X11 window for each window on the server side.  This mode requires the
              SeamlessRDP server side component, which is available from http://www.cendio.com/seamlessrdp/.

              When using this option, you should normally specify a startup shell which launches the desired application through SeamlessRDP.

              Example: rdesktop -A 'c:\seamlessrdp\seamlessrdpshell.exe' -s 'notepad' mywts.domain.com

              Any subsequential call to the above command line example will make use of the seamless connection sharing feature which spawns another notepad in the current connection  to
              the specified server and then exit.

       -V <tls version>
              Set the Transport Level Security (also known as SSL) Version used.  Should be one of the following values: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2. By default all versions are supported.

       -B     Use the BackingStore of the Xserver instead of the integrated one in rdesktop.

       -e     Disable encryption.  This option is only needed (and will only work) if you have a French version of NT TSE.

       -E     Disable encryption from client to server.  This sends an encrypted login packet, but everything after this is unencrypted (including interactive logins).

       -m     Do not send mouse motion events.  This saves bandwidth, although some Windows applications may rely on receiving mouse motion.

       -M     Use local X cursor inherited from window manager instead of server cursor. This is mostly useful with -m, but is also useful if the server is sending bogus mouse cursors.

       -C     Use private colourmap.  This will improve colour accuracy on an 8-bit display, but rdesktop will appear in false colour when not focused.

       -D     Hide window manager decorations, by using MWM hints.

       -K     Do not override window manager key bindings.  By default rdesktop attempts to grab all keyboard input when it is in focus.

       -S <button size>
              Enable  single  application  mode.  This  option  can  be used when running a single, maximized application (via -s). When the minimize button of the windows application is
              pressed, the rdesktop window is minimized instead of the remote application. The maximize/restore button is disabled. For this to work, you must specify the correct  button
              size, in pixels. The special word "standard" means 18 pixels.

       -T <title>
              Sets the window title. The title must be specified using an UTF-8 string.

       -N     Enable  numlock  synchronization between the Xserver and the remote RDP session.  This is useful with applications that looks at the numlock state, but might cause problems
              with some Xservers like Xvnc.

       -X <windowid>
              Embed rdesktop-window in another window. The windowid is expected to be decimal or hexadecimal (prefixed by 0x).

       -a <bpp>
              Sets the colour depth for the connection (8, 15, 16, 24 or 32).  More than 8 bpp are only supported when connecting to Windows XP (up to 16 bpp) or newer.   Note  that  the
              colour depth may also be limited by the server configuration. The default value is the depth of the root window.

       -z     Enable compression of the RDP datastream.

       -x <experience>
              Changes default bandwidth performance behaviour for RDP5. By default only theming is enabled, and all other options are disabled (corresponding to modem (56 Kbps)). Setting
              experience to b[roadband] enables menu animations and full window dragging. Setting experience to l[an] will also  enable  the  desktop  wallpaper.  Setting  experience  to
              m[odem] disables all (including themes). Experience can also be a hexadecimal number containing the flags.

       -P     Enable  caching of bitmaps to disk (persistent bitmap caching). This generally improves performance (especially on low bandwidth connections) and reduces network traffic at
              the cost of slightly longer startup and some disk space.  (10MB for 8-bit colour, 20MB for 15/16-bit colour, 30MB for 24-bit colour and 40MB for 32-bit colour sessions)

       -r <device>
              Enable redirection of the specified device on the client, such that it appears on the server. Note that the allowed redirections may be restricted by the server  configura‐
              tion.

              Following devices are currently supported:

       -r comport:<comport>=<device>,...
              Redirects  serial devices on your client to the server. Note that if you need to change any settings on the serial device(s), do so with an appropriate tool before starting
              rdesktop. In most OSes you would use stty. Bidirectional/Read support requires Windows XP or newer.  In Windows 2000 it will create a port,  but  it's  not  seamless,  most
              shell programs will not work with it.

       -r disk:<sharename>=<path>,...
              Redirects a path to the share \\tsclient\<sharename> on the server (requires Windows XP or newer). The share name is limited to 8 characters.

       -r lptport:<lptport>=<device>,...
              Redirects parallel devices on your client to the server.  Bidirectional/Read support requires Windows XP or newer. In Windows 2000 it will create a port, but it's not seam‐
              less, most shell programs will not work with it.

       -r printer:<printername>[=<driver>],...
              Redirects a printer queue on the client to the server. The <printername> is the name of the queue in your local system. <driver> defaults to a simple PS-driver  unless  you
              specify  one.  Keep in mind that you need a 100% match in the server environment, or the driver will fail. The first printer on the command line will be set as your default
              printer.

       -r sound:[local|off|remote]
              Redirects sound generated on the server to the client. "remote" only has any effect when you connect to the console with the -0 option. (Requires Windows XP or newer).

       -r lspci
              Activates the lspci channel, which allows the server to enumerate the clients PCI devices. See the file lspci-channel.txt in the documentation for more information.

       -r scard[:<Scard Name>=<Alias Name>[;<Vendor Name>][,...]]
              Enables redirection of one or more smart-cards. You can provide static name binding between GNU/Linux and Windows. To do this you can use optional parameters as  described:
              <Scard  Name> - device name in GNU/Linux and UNIX environment, <Alias Name> - device name shown in Windows environment <Vendor Name> - optional device vendor name. For list
              of examples run rdesktop without parameters.

       -r clipboard:[off|PRIMARYCLIPBOARD|CLIPBOARD]
              Enable clipboard redirection. 'PRIMARYCLIPBOARD' looks at both PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD when sending data to server. 'CLIPBOARD' looks at only 'CLIPBOARD'.

       -0     Attach to the console of the server (requires Windows Server 2003 or newer).

       -4     Use RDP version 4.

       -5     Use RDP version 5 (default).

       -v     Enable verbose output

CredSSP Smartcard options
       --sc-csp-name <name>
              Specify the CSP (Crypto Service Provider) to use on the windows side for the smartcard authentication. CSP is the driver for your smartcard and it seems like  this  is  re‐
              quired to be specified for CredSSP authentication. For Swedish NetID the following CSP name is used; "Net iD - CSP".

       --sc-container-name <name>
              Specify the container name, usually this is the username for default container and it seems like this is required to be specified for CredSSP authentication.

       --sc-reader-name <name>
              Specify the reader name to be used to prevent the pin code being sent to wrong card if there are several readers.

       --sc-card-name <name>
              Specify the card name for example; "Telia EID IP5a".
